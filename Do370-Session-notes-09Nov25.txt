#Products:-
- Red Hat OpenShift COntainer Platform (RHOCPv416).
- Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (RHODFv416).
- Classroom Environment (Pending discussion):-

Unit-1- Architecture Overview and Deployment of OpenShift Data Foundation by Using Internal Mode.
- ODF - OpenShift Data Foundation.
- ODF is a software define storage solution.
- HOw ODF integrated with Red Hat OpenShift (RHOSP).
- It provides Persistent Storage and it support (Block/File/Object storgae).

- Default nature of container is ephemeral (Tmp Storage).
- ODF provides Enterprise Storage solution to Red Hat OpenShift (RHOKE/RHOSP/RHOPP).
- ODFv416 is based on technologies like:-
 1- Ceph (Higly scalable distributed storage - SDS)
 2- NooBaa (Object data service / s3 gateway)
 3- Rook (Operator for managing Ceph)
 4- CSI (COntainer Storage INterface)
 
ODF (Internal)
- Local Storage Operator
- ODF Operator

1-) Storage Backend (Actual Storage):-
 - Local Disk: Direct-attached block storage on Physical node.
 - Cloud Storage Block - Cloud providers-managed block volume (Eg: AWS EBS, Azure Disk).
 - Hypervisor Block Storage - Block device exposed from virtulization platform.
 Local OPerator managing above block storage for ODF deployment.
 
 - Cloud Object Storage (Via only NooBaa) - NooBaa via MCG can connect to any Object
   Storage provider (AWS/Azure/GCP/IBM etc)
 
2-) Core Storage services:-
  2.1 Cpeh Service (Distributed Storage System):-
    - RADOS - Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store - Core Staore engine of Ceph.
    - RBD - RADOS Block Device - Provide Block Storage 
	- CpehFS - Ceph File system - NAS level storage 
	- RGW - RADOS Gateway - S3 compatible Object Storage.

  2.2 NooBaa Service:-
    - NooBaa enables MCG (Multicloud Object Gatway), managing S3-compatible bucket from:
      - Local Ceph RGW 
      - External cloud object storage (Eg:- AWS S3, Azure Blob etc ).
3-) CLient & CSI Plugins (CSI - COntainer Storage Plugins).
    - CSI plugins provides interface to use any Storage solution (Only BLock/File Storge )
    - RBD client - Communicate with RADOS Block devices.
    - CephFS CLient - MOunt ceph file system.
	
	Note: These client are integrated into kubernetes via SCI plugins, which allow container/VM (KubeVirt) 
	      to mount storage volume as Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
